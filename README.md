A 3D world displayed via PyOpenGL.

## Run:

Dependencies:

```

## Goal:

Basically to make a mini minecraft-like game.

## Current:

Can fly around and look at simple objects.

## To Do:

- Get FPS perspective to work (quaternion rotation not yet implemented).
- Add basic rigid physics.
- Deal with near limit on frustrum.
- Capture mouse to allow for infinite movement? (like most FPS controlled games)
